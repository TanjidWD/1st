 <h1 align="center"> TREE PLANTATION</h1><HR/>
 <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tree plantation refers to planting more trees across the country. A happy and peaceful life is not possible without trees.</p><p align="justify"> Some people are recklessly cutting down trees everywhere. They do not think that the destruction of trees destroys the ecosystem. As a result, our country is going to become a whole desert.</p><p align="justify"> In this we may face problems like flood, land erosion, lack of rain etc. It poses a great threat to our ecosystem. Trees play a significant role in our day to day life. We need oxygen to survive.</p><p align="justify"> Trees give us this oxygen. They give us food and fruits. They also shelter us. From trees we get wood and without wood we cannot make household furniture, boats, launches, ships etc. If trees are planted along the banks of rivers and seas, erosion can be prevented.</p><p align="justify"> It also prevents air pollution. Trees protect the country from harmful greenhouse effect. The higher lands of the river valleys are suitable for growth and development of afforestation. Beaches, lowlands and wastelands can be brought under afforestation with specific types of trees suitable for the soil.</p> <p align="justify">June-July is the best time for planting. We should plant more trees to save the environment. Plantation programs should be extended to remote areas of the country. Officials concerned with this program should take proper steps and necessary measures to make it successful.</p> <p align="justify"> Government should take necessary steps to encourage people to plant trees. The necessity and importance of trees can never be ignored. So it is our duty to plant more trees and take care of them for our own well-being and existence.</p>
